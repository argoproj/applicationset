# Changelog

# v0.2.0

I am happy to announce the second release of the Argo CD ApplicationSet controller, v0.2.0. Many new features were contributed as part of this release, including support for combining generator parameters, support for building Argo CD Applications based on GitHub/GitLab organizations, and support for using custom resources to select clusters, plus oft requested improvements to existing generators, and of course doc updates, usability improvements, stability fixes, and more. 

You can learn more about this from the [ApplicationSet documentation](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io) or check out the source [and learn how you can contribute](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/).

## Contributors

Many many thanks to all the folks who have contributed to the ApplicationSet controller over the past few months. These many contributions, both big and small, general and specific, help to bring a more featureful and polished experience to Argo CD users. We could not do this without all of you!

## New in this Release

### Matrix generator

The Matrix generator is a new generator that combines the parameters generated by two child generators, iterating through every combination of each generator's set:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: cluster-git
spec:
  generators:
    - matrix: # 'Parent' Matrix Generator
        generators:
          - git: # 'Child' generator A
              repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset.git
              revision: HEAD
              directories:
                - path: examples/matrix/cluster-addons/*
          - clusters: # 'Child' generator B
              selector:
                matchLabels:
                  argocd.argoproj.io/secret-type: cluster
  template:
  # (...)
```

The parameters generated by a Git generator (looking for directories within a Git Repository), and by a Cluster generator (looking for Argo CD-managed clusters), are combined: this will generate Argo CD Applications that target each of the Git directories (containing Kubernetes manifests), for each cluster managed by Argo CD.

See the [Matrix generator documentation](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io/en/master/Generators-Matrix/) for an in-depth example of how generator parameters are combined. Contributed by [@OmerKahani](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/205).


### SCM Provider generator

The SCM Provider generator is a new generator that utilizes the API of GitHub/GitLab to automatically discover repositories within an organization, allowing the repository values to be used for targeting generated Argo CD Applications. This fits well with GitOps layout patterns that split microservices across many repositories, rather than those patterns that stick to a single repository (which can be handled by other ApplicationSet generators).

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: myapps
spec:
  generators:
  - scmProvider:
      github:
        organization: myorg         # The GitHub organization to scan.
        tokenRef: { } # Reference to a Secret containing an access token. (optional)
  template:
  # ...
```

The ApplicationSet controller will then scan the provided GitHub/GitLab organization and produce template parameters for each discovered repository/branch, which may be used to generate Argo CD Applications for each of these repositories.

See the [SCM Provider generator](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io/en/master/Generators-SCM-Provider/) documentation for more information. Initial implementation and GitHub support contributed by [@coderanger](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/209), and GitLab support contributed by [@empath-nirvana](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/283).


### Cluster Decision Resource generator

The Cluster Decision Resource generator is a new generator that generates a list of Argo CD clusters based on the contents of an external custom resource (CR), with that custom resource managed by an external controller. With the Cluster Decision Resource generator, you may 'outsource' the logic (of which clusters to target) to third party controllers/CRs, such as the [Open Cluster Management's Placements](https://open-cluster-management.io/concepts/placement/). 

This is handled seamlessly using [duck-typing](https://knative.dev/docs/developer/concepts/duck-typing/), which does not require knowledge of the full shape of the referenced Kubernetes resource. The following is an example of a cluster-decision-resource-based ApplicationSet generator: 
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
 name: guestbook
spec:
 generators:
 - clusterDecisionResource:
    # ConfigMap with GVK information for the duck type resource
    configMapRef: my-configmap      
    name: quak  # Choose either "name" of the resource or "labelSelector"
```

Which might reference an external resource named `quak`, managed by an external controller, containing a list of clusters:
```yaml
apiVersion: mallard.io/v1beta1
kind: Duck
metadata:
  name: quak
spec: {}
status:
  decisions:   # Duck-typing ignores all other aspects of the resource except the "decisions" list
  - clusterName: cluster-01
  - clusterName: cluster-02
```

See the [Cluster Decision Resource](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io/en/master/Generators-Cluster-Decision-Resource/) generator documentation for more information. [Cluster Decision Resource generator](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/231) and [labelSelector support](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/272) contributed by [@jnpacker](https://github.com/jnpacker).

### Preserve Application child resources on deletion of parent ApplicationSet

By default, Applications created and managed by the ApplicationSet controller include the [Argo CD resource deletion finalizer](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/app_deletion/#about-the-deletion-finalizer). This means that when an ApplicationSet is deleted, its child Applications will be deleted, as well as the cluster resources of those child Applications. This is the same behaviour as a cascade delete within Argo CD.

However, this behaviour is not always desirable: one may want to preserve the Application child resources on deletion of the parent Application. To enable this, using the `.spec.syncPolicy.preserveResourcesOnDeletion` value in the parent ApplicationSet:
```yaml
kind: ApplicationSet
spec:
  generators:
    - clusters: {}
  template:
    # (...)
  syncPolicy:
    # Don't delete Application's child resources, on parent deletion:
    preserveResourcesOnDeletion: true
```

See the [Application Deletion Behaviour](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io/en/master/Application-Deletion/) documentation for more information. Contributed by [@mmatur](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/223).


### Add YAML configuration file support to Git File generator

In the previous ApplicationSet release, only JSON-formatted configuration files were supported by the Git File generator. Now, both [JSON and YAML files are supported](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io/en/master/Generators-Git/#git-generator-files), and may be used interchangeably. Contributed by [@teejaded](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/211).

### Allow any key/value pair in List generator

The List generator previously only supported a fixed list of cluster name/URL values, with an optional values field for user-defined values. You can now specify any key/value pair:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
spec:
 generators:
 - list:
     elements:
     # current form, still supported:
     - cluster: engineering-dev
       url: https://kubernetes.default.svc
       values:
         additional: value
     # new form, does not require cluster/URL keys:
     - staging: true
       gitRepo: https://kubernetes.default.svc   
 template:
   # (...)
```

This new form is fully backwards compatible with existing v0.1.0-originated ApplicationSets, and no migration steps are needed. See the [List generator](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io/en/master/Generators-List/) documentation for more information.  Contributed by [@ishitasequeira](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/290).

### Added additional path params to Git File generator

The Git File generator now produces `{{ path }}` and `{{ path.basename }}` parameters, containing the path of the configuration file, similar to the same parameters already produced by the Git Directory generator. Contributed by [@ishitasequeira](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/260).

### Add exclude path support to Git directories

The Git Directory generator scans directories within a Git repository, looking for directories that match specific criteria. However, with the previous ApplicationSet release, there was no way to exclude folders from the scan. 

The ability to [exclude individual paths from being scanned](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io/en/master/Generators-Git/#exclude-directories) is now supported:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: cluster-addons
spec:
  generators:
  - git:
      repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset.git
      revision: HEAD
      directories:
      # Include this first path 
      - path: examples/git-generator-directory/excludes/cluster-addons/* 
      # But, exclude this second path:
      - path: examples/git-generator-directory/excludes/cluster-addons/exclude-helm-guestbook
        exclude: true
```        
Contributed by [@LiorLieberman](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/pull/195).

## Installation

The ApplicationSet controller must be installed into the same namespace as the Argo CD it is targeting:
```
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/v0.2.0/manifests/install.yaml
```

Once installed, the ApplicationSet controller requires no additional setup. You can learn more about ApplicationSet controller installation from the [Getting Started](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io/en/v0.2.0/Getting-Started/) page.



# v0.1.0

I am excited to announce the first release of the Argo CD ApplicationSet controller, v0.1.0, releasing now alongside Argo CD v2.0!

The ApplicationSet controller provides the ability:
- To deploy Argo CD Applications to multiple Kubernetes clusters at once
- To deploy multiple Argo CD applications from a single monorepo
- Allows unprivileged cluster users (those without access to the Argo CD namespace) to deploy Argo CD applications without the need to involve cluster administrators in enabling the destination clusters/namespaces

BUT, best of all, all these features are controlled by only a single ApplicationSet Kubernetes custom resource, which means no more juggling of multiple Argo CD Application resources to target those multiple clusters/repos!

Unlike with an Argo CD Application resource, which deploys resources from a single Git repository to a single destination cluster/namespace, ApplicationSet uses templated automation to create, modify, and manage multiple Argo CD applications at once.

You can learn more about this from the [ApplicationSet documentation](https://argocd-applicationset.readthedocs.io) or check out the source [and learn how you can contribute](https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset/).

Since this is our first release, we would ❤️ if you would give ApplicationSets a shot, and let us know what cool problems you are solving with it, or what pain points you hit.
Got feature requests, bug reports, or want to contribute code? Let us know on our project repository, or join us on [#argo-cd-appset on Slack](https://argoproj.github.io/community/join-slack).

The ApplicationSet controller would not exist without the contributions of these talented individuals! 🎉️

## New in this Release

### List Generator

The List generator generates parameters based on a fixed list of cluster name/URL values, with those values passed as parameters into the template. This allows manual control over Application destinations via editing of a literal list with the ApplicationSet.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
spec:
 generators:
 - list:
     elements:
     - cluster: engineering-dev
       url: https://kubernetes.default.svc
#    - cluster: engineering-prod
#      url: (another cluster API url)
 template:
   spec:
     project: default
     source:
       repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset.git
       targetRevision: HEAD
       path: examples/list-generator/guestbook/{{cluster}}
     # (...)
```       
In this example, if one wanted to add a second cluster, we could uncomment the second cluster element and the ApplicationSet controller would automatically target it with the defined application.

### Cluster Generator

The cluster generator is useful if you are using Argo CD to manage cluster add-ons, such as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) or Ingress Controllers, across a fleet of clusters. Instead of manually creating an application for each cluster, you can delegate it to the cluster generator. 

In Argo CD, managed clusters are stored within Secrets in the Argo CD namespace. The ApplicationSet controller uses those same Secrets to generate template parameters for which to target available clusters.

The Cluster generator will automatically identify clusters defined with Argo CD, and extract the cluster data as parameters:
```yaml
kind: ApplicationSet
spec:
  generators:
  - clusters: {} # Automatically use all clusters defined within Argo CD
  template:
    metadata:
      name: '{{name}}-guestbook' # 'name' field of the cluster
    spec:
      source: 
        # (...)
      destination:
        server: '{{server}}' # 'server' field of the cluster
        namespace: guestbook
```


### Git Directory Generator

It is a good practice to define a convention between Argo CD application name and the location of the deployment manifests directory with the Git repository. For example, you might choose to store all manifests of production applications under "applications/prod/<app-name>" and all staging applications under "applications/staging/<app-name>".

The Git Directory generator allows you to go one step further and "codify" that convention. The Git directory generator generates template parameters using the directory structure of a specified Git repository.
Whenever a new subfolder is added to the Git repository, the ApplicationSet controller will detect this change and automatically use the subfolder path to template an Argo CD application containing the manifests contained within that folder (whether they be plain YAML, Kustomize, Helm, etc).

```yaml
kind: ApplicationSet
spec:
  generators:
  - git:
      repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset.git
      revision: HEAD
      directories:
      - path: examples/git-generator-directory/cluster-addons/*
# (...)
```

### Git File Generator

Similar to the Directory generator, the Git File generator allows you to generate applications based on Git repository content but provide a bit more flexibility. The Git file generator generates template parameters using the contents of JSON files found within a specified repository.
Git commits containing changes to JSON files are automatically discovered by the Git generator, and the contents of those files are parsed and converted into template parameters.

This allows the creation of custom Argo CD Applications based on the contents of automatically discovered JSON files within the repository. As new files are added/changed, new Argo Applications are created or modified.

```yaml
kind: ApplicationSet
spec:
  generators:
  - git:
      repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset.git
      revision: HEAD
      files:
      - path: "examples/git-generator-files-discovery/cluster-config/**/config.json"
```


### Brand new documentation and examples

The ApplicationSet controller has a brand new set of documentation and examples. Topics include introduction, a quick getting started guide, use cases, the interaction with Argo CD, generators, template fields, application lifecycle, and more.

### Template Override

In addition to specifying a template within the `.spec.template` of the ApplicationSet resource, templates may also be specified within generators. This is useful for overriding the values of the spec-level template with generator-specific values.

```yaml
spec:
  generators:
  - list:
      elements:
        - cluster: engineering-dev
          url: https://kubernetes.default.svc
      template: # <--- A template under a list generator
        metadata: {}
        spec:
          project: "default"
          source:
            revision: HEAD
            repoURL: https://github.com/argoproj-labs/applicationset.git
            # New path value is generated here:
            path: 'examples/template-override/{{cluster}}-override'
          destination: {}
```


### Support for arbitrary key/value pairs in Cluster generator and List generator

Arbitrary key/value pairs may be included within the Cluster and List generators, which will be converted into template parameters during template rendering. This is useful for providing custom parameters for a specific generator instance:
```yaml
spec:
  generators:
  - clusters:
      values:
        version: '2.0.0'
```     



### Bugs, tests, and infrastructure improvements

In addition to the above new features, we delivered lots of bug fixes, new unit tests, a new end-to-end test framework, new end-to-end tests, a new release process, and build/test infrastructure improvements.




## Installation
