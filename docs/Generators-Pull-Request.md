# Pull Request Generator

The Pull Request generator uses the API of an SCMaaS provider (eg GitHub) to automatically discover opening pull requests within an repository. This fits well with the style of building a test environment when you create a pull request.


```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: myapps
spec:
  generators:
  - pullRequest:
      # See below for provider specific options.
      github:
        # ...
```

## GitHub

Specify the repository from which to fetch the Github Pull requests.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: myapps
spec:
  generators:
  - pullRequest:
      github:
        # The GitHub organization or user.
        owner: myorg
        # The Github repository
        repo: myrepository
        # For GitHub Enterprise (optional)
        api: https://git.example.com/
        # Reference to a Secret containing an access token. (optional)
        tokenRef:
          secretName: github-token
          key: token
        # Labels is used to filter the PRs that you want to target. (optional)
        labels:
        - preview
  template:
  # ...
```

* `owner`: Required name of the GitHub organization or user.
* `repo`: Required name of the Github repositry.
* `api`: If using GitHub Enterprise, the URL to access it. (Optional)
* `tokenRef`: A `Secret` name and key containing the GitHub access token to use for requests. If not specified, will make anonymous requests which have a lower rate limit and can only see public repositories. (Optional)
* `labels`: Labels is used to filter the PRs that you want to target. (Optional)

## Template

As with all generators, several keys are available for replacement in the generated application.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ApplicationSet
metadata:
  name: myapps
spec:
  generators:
  - pullRequest:
    # ...
  template:
    metadata:
      name: 'myapp-{{ branch }}-{{ number }}'
    spec:
      source:
        repoURL: 'https://github.com/myorg/myrepo.git'
        targetRevision: '{{ head_sha }}'
        path: kubernetes/
        helm:
          parameters:
          - name: "image.tag"
            value: "pull-{{ head_sha }}"
      project: default
      destination:
        server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
        namespace: default
```

* `number`: The ID number of the pull request.
* `branch`: The name of the branch of the pull request head.
* `head_sha`: This is the SHA of the head of the pull request.
